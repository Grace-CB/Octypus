* FIX:

Filtering issues. Solved, at least practically, for the moment. Need to test with more robust range of outputs.


* ADD:

Command line arguments
Selectable 'levels of detail' for output reports?
Suppress shell output? As an option?
Benchmarking when debugging is active (Benchmark module)


* REFACTOR:

Oh, just everything. There's so much code duplication it hurts.
Curry off all the date handling so we can skip duplicating formatting issues
Curry off just everything we can. Seriously -- the date handling, duh, but formatting stuff, maybe even filehandle stuff.
