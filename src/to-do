* FIX:

Filtering issues.


* ADD:

Command line arguments
Selectable 'levels of detail' for output reports?
Suppress shell output? As an option?
Benchmarking when debugging is active


* REFACTOR:

Oh, just everything. There's so much code duplication it hurts.
Curry off all the date handling so we can skip duplicating formatting issues
