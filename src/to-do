NU = Not Urgent, NI = Not Important, U = Urgent, I = Important

* FIX:

I/U	Filtering issues. Solved, at least practically, for the moment. Need to test with more robust range of outputs.


* ADD:

I/U	Still working tickydoodle
I/U	Command line arguments
NU/I	Selectable 'levels of detail' for output reports?
NU/NI	Suppress shell output? As an option?
NU/I	Benchmarking when debugging is active (Benchmark module)


* REFACTOR:

U/NI	Oh, just everything. There's so much code duplication it hurts.
NU/NI	Curry off all the date handling so we can skip duplicating formatting issues
	Curry off just everything we can. Seriously -- the date handling, duh, but formatting stuff, maybe even filehandle stuff.
